I am a Mechanical Engineer turn into a Machine Learning researcher. My interest is on the mathematical modelling and theoretical analysis to gain insights into the problems of interest. Before getting into the academic career, I worked as a Process and Equipment Engineer at Intel Products Vietnam for three years.

Beside my academic life, I have a simple life as a country guy coming from a small town in the South of Vietname, where the Mekong river flows out to the South China Sea. It has a complex river system which provides illuvi to plant different kinds of fruit-trees.
