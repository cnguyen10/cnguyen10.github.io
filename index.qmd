Hello, my name is **C&#x1B0;&#x1EDD;ng Cao Nguy&#x1EC5;n** (pronounced similarly to: *Ker-uhng Kao Ner-win*). I am currently a **Research Associate** at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide working with Professor Gustavo Carneiro.

<br />

I am currently working on *noisy-label learning* where the aim is to infer a good model in the presence of noisy annotation. I also engage into teaching undergraduate courses.

My interest is in the mathematical modelling and theoretical analysis to gain insights and deepen my understanding. In particular, I am interested in the following topics, including but not limited to:

- Probabilistic machine learning
- Bayesian inference
- Statistical machine learning (i.e., PAC-learning)
