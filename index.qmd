## Biography

::: {.text-start}
I am a *Research Fellow* at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey.

Before that, I was a *Research Associate* at the School of Computer Science, The University of Adelaide from April 2022 to January 2024. I received my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Adelaide in March 2022, an MPhil in Electronic Engineering also from The University of Adelaide in January 2018, and a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Portland State University in June 2012.

## Areas of study

My main research interest include probabilistic machine learning and graphical models. In particular, I prefer modelling how the given data is generated (e.g., through a graphical model), then perform parameter inference on such a modelling using the Expectation - Maximisation or variational inference coupled with some numerical optimisation techniques. I am also interested in statistical machine learning (e.g., PAC learning).
