                <li><em>research in human-AI cooperation:</em> Current setting in human-AI cooperation requires <em>(i)</em> each sample must be annotated by all human experts, and <em>(ii)</em> each annotation must be associated with the identification of a human expert. Such requirements complicate the data collection, resulting in a more expensive and time-consuming process. My research is to relax each of the two assumptions to increase the applicability and practicability of human-AI cooperation, and</li>

                <li><em>research in the identifiability of noisy label learning:</em> The noisy label learning problem with a single noisy label per sample is non-identifiable, meaning that there are infinite number of models that can generate the given dataset. My research is to find conditions to make the problem identifiable (i.e., having one unique solution). In short, for a C-way classification problem, at least (2C - 1) noisy labels per sample must be collected,</li>
                <li>co-supervise a PhD student in the same topic about noisy label learning, and</li>
